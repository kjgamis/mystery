CHOICES

First Choice: 1. Stick with the PB&J your mom packed you. You're really looking forward to those Hip Tunes..
Second Choice: 1. Get to work helping. Take a look around the room. Look for people and things that look suspicious or stand out. The sooner begun, the sooner done.

Third Choice: 1. Approach Helga and the Doctor
Fourth Choice: 1. Listen in on what they're saying
Fifth Choice: 4. Approach Danny
Sixth Choice: 3. Approach Billy
Seventh Choice: 1. Listen in on what he's saying
Eighth Choice: 2. Approach Helga and the Doctor
Ninth Choice: 2. Talk to them directly
Tenth Choice: 2. Seriously, where did this Doctor even come from? Isn't it pretty suspicious that he ran in just after Mr. Body was murdered? It must've been him. Accuse him.
